# Example Patch: Placeholder for Build Compatibility
# Upstream Version: v1.9.1
# Reason: This is an example patch file to demonstrate the patch application workflow
# Status: Placeholder - Replace with actual patches as build issues are discovered
#
# NOTE: This patch does not modify any files. It serves as a template and validation
# that the patch application task works correctly.
#
# When you discover actual build issues that require patching:
# 1. Make changes in the podman-desktop submodule
# 2. Generate a real patch: cd podman-desktop && git diff > ../patches/002-real-fix.patch
# 3. Remove or replace this example patch
#
# For now, this empty patch will pass validation and demonstrate the workflow.
